#### What is this thing?

It is a C++ library, distributed as a set of relatively independent code modules.

#### What is it good for?

It allows you to code all sorts of things in a bit more modern style, at least IMHO. The API design is inspired by dynamic languages such as javascript, and by modern C++11 idioms. See the [Examples](index.html) for an idea of how it can look.

#### Why not use boost?

Why not indeed? Apone does not really have the same design goals. It is a much smaller project and hopefully not as interdependant. And specifcally it provides less generic and more system specific modules, for *graphics*, *audio*, *databases* etc -- often as a wrapper on top of a 3rd party library (such as *Open GL* or *SQLite*).

#### Which platforms does it work on?

Linux, Mac OS X, Raspberry PI, Emscripten. Android soon working again. Windows hopefully in time. iOS if someone helps me.

#### Retro music formats and telnet consoles... really?

Yes, there are some modules here that are not for everyone. If you're the right type of nerd, enjoy it -- otherwise those modules can be safely ignored :)
